          <p class="typesCoffee-paragraph">
            Coffee enthusiasts delight in the diverse array of coffee types,<br>
            each offering a unique flavor profile and experience. From the smooth,<br>
            balanced notes of a classic Arabica to the bold, intense flavors of <br>
            obusta, there's a bean for every palate. Espresso lovers savor the <br>
            rich, concentrated essence of finely ground coffee, while those who <br>

            drinks like cappuccinos and lattes blend the robustness of espresso <br>
            with the creamy texture of steamed milk, creating a perfect harmony <br>
            of taste and texture. Whether you enjoy a simple black coffee or a <br>
            complex, multi-layered brew, the world of coffee is vast and <br>

          <p class="historyCoffee-paragraph">
            The history of coffee is a rich and fascinating journey that <br>
            spans centuries and continents. Legend has it that coffee was <br>
            discovered in Ethiopia by a goat herder named Kaldi, who noticed <br>
            his goats becoming particularly energetic after eating the red <br>
            berries of a certain shrub. By the 15th century, coffee had spread<br>
            to the Arabian Peninsula, where it became an integral part of Middle <br>
            Eastern culture. Coffeehouses, known as qahveh khaneh, became popular <br>
            social hubs in cities like Mecca and Istanbul, where people gathered<br>
            to discuss politics, listen to music, and enjoy the stimulating <br>
            beverage. The 17th century saw coffee's introduction to Europe, where<br>
            it quickly gained popularity, leading to the establishment of <br>
            iconic coffeehouses that became centers of intellectual and artistic<br>
            activity. Today, coffee is a global phenomenon, with countless <br>
            variations and preparations that reflect the diverse cultures and <br>
            traditions it has touched throughout its storied history.
